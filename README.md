# Emotion Detection System

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting the emotional state of a person using image analysis powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The system processes facial expressions from images to classify emotions accurately.

## Features
- **Image-Based Emotion Detection**: Identifies emotions from facial expressions.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes advanced models for accurate classification.
- **User Interface**: Developed an interactive interface for real-time emotion detection.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Keras
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Flask / Streamlit (for UI)

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled images representing different emotional states.
- Preprocessing steps include face detection, resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Emotion-Detection-System.git
cd Emotion-Detection-System

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the emotion detection system:

```bash
python detect_emotion.py --image sample.jpg
```

To launch the user interface:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Results
- Successfully detected emotions from facial expressions.
- Achieved high accuracy with deep learning models.
- Developed a user-friendly interface for real-time detection.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy using larger datasets.
- Implement real-time video-based emotion detection.
- Integrate with applications like chatbots and virtual assistants.
